# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to a customer dataset to segment customers into distinct groups based on several features, including:
- **Age**
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1-100)**
- **Number of Transactions** (synthetic feature)
- **Average Transaction Value** (synthetic feature)
- **Transaction Frequency** (synthetic feature)

The goal of this analysis is to help businesses better understand their customer base and target specific segments for marketing strategies.

## Features
The script generates the following results:
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers into groups based on the above features.
2. **Cluster Visualization**: Plots customer segments based on annual income and spending score, highlighting cluster centroids.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Summary of each cluster’s characteristics, including average age, income, spending score, number of transactions, transaction value, and transaction frequency.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains customer demographic data. The file is expected to have the following columns:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

### CAONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS
1. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that can improve the performance of machine learning models. In this assignment, feature engineering could include creating new features such as:

Transaction Frequency: Calculating how often customers make purchases.

Average Transaction Value: Deriving the mean value per transaction based on annual income or spending score.

Demographic Features: Using age or other demographic data to better segment customers. These engineered features could provide better insights into customer behavior, improving clustering accuracy.

2. Model Interpretability
Model interpretability refers to how easily we can understand and explain the decisions made by a machine learning model. In this context:

The k-means clustering algorithm is inherently interpretable, as each customer is assigned to a cluster based on the proximity to the cluster centroid.
We can understand the characteristics of each cluster by analyzing the key features like income, age, and spending score, and then draw business conclusions about customer segmentation.
In fintech, interpretability is crucial for regulatory compliance and trust, especially for security-sensitive applications.

3. Imbalanced Datasets
Imbalanced datasets occur when one class or segment is over-represented compared to others. In this assignment, if the customer base has a disproportionate number of customers with similar spending habits or demographics, it may lead to biased cluster formation. For example:

If most customers have a high spending score, the model might ignore smaller but significant groups of low spenders. Handling this would involve balancing the dataset, perhaps through resampling or feature weighting, to ensure all customer segments are fairly represented.

4. Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is used to identify unusual patterns or behaviors that don't conform to expected norms. 

In this assignment:
Anomaly detection could be applied to identify outliers in customer behavior, such as fraudulent transactions or customers with extremely high or low spending.
By detecting these outliers, the system can flag potential fraud or identify customers that require special attention, like VIPs or at-risk customers.

5. Cross-validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times. In this context:

Cross-validation ensures the k-means clustering model generalizes well and avoids overfitting to a particular subset of data.
Since clustering doesn't rely on labels, techniques like Silhouette Score or Adjusted Rand Index can be used to evaluate the clustering performance across different validation sets.

Scenario-Based Question
Scenario: Eazr wants to implement a real-time recommendation system to suggest relevant offers to users based on their transaction history.
What type of recommendation system (collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid) would you choose and why?

1. I would choose a hybrid recommendation system for Eazr because:

Collaborative filtering works well when there is sufficient transaction history and user behavior data (e.g., users who made similar transactions).
Content-based filtering uses transaction attributes (e.g., transaction type, amount, frequency) to recommend offers based on the user’s past behavior.
A hybrid approach combines the strengths of both, mitigating weaknesses like the cold-start problem (discussed below) and providing better recommendations by leveraging both user behavior and transaction content.

2. How would you handle the cold-start problem for new users?

The cold-start problem arises when new users join the system without any transaction history. To handle this:

Demographic-based recommendations: Use features like age, location, and income to make initial recommendations, which could be inferred from customer profile data.
Popular offers: Recommend the most popular offers to new users until they generate enough transaction history.
Ask for preferences: A simple survey when onboarding users to learn their preferences can be used for initial recommendations.
Which metrics would you use to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system?

3. To evaluate the recommendation system, the following metrics can be used:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of the recommendations. It is the ratio of relevant offers to the total offers recommended.
Recall: Measures how well the system identifies all relevant offers. It’s the ratio of correctly recommended relevant offers to all relevant offers available.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): Evaluates how well the relevant offers rank in the recommended list.
Mean Average Precision (MAP): Used for ranking multiple relevant recommendations and gives an overall performance measure.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): Measures how many users clicked on the recommended offers, providing insight into user engagement.
Conversion Rate: Measures how many users acted on the recommendation (e.g., redeemed offers), indicating business value from the system.
